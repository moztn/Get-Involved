# How to get involved in the Mozilla Tunisia Community

Welcome and thanks for your interest in joining our community. If you’re new to Mozilla Tunisia you might want to start by filling this little [temporal] [joining-form](http://tunisia.arabicmozilla.org/) to join our family. 

Here we’ve compiled a list of steps how you can get involved and contribute to Mozilla and Mozilla Tunisia projects :

- Step zero : Fill the joining form.
- Step 1 : Choose your team ! We have four working teams in our community where you might find your contribution area, check them out for more infomation : The [coding team](https://github.com/moztn/Coding-Team) - The [localizing team](https://github.com/moztn/Localization-Team) - The [education team](https://github.com/moztn/Education-Team) - The [speaking team](https://github.com/moztn/Speaking-Team).
- Step 2 : Make a profile on [Mozillians.org](https://mozillians.org/en-US/) where you can find mozillians from all over the world.
- Step 2.5 : You may also join the [Mozilla Tunisia group](https://mozillians.org/en-US/group/mozilla-tunisia/) there.
- Step 3 : You will be assigned to a mentor who will contact you in order to introduce you to the team, members and project. 

Your mentor is also here to answer your questions, helping you to know more about the tools and Mozilla as well as the rest of the community. Once you're in touch with your mentor, you are ready to start your adventure.

# Communication channels

At Mozilla Tunisia, we're using a couple of tools and platforms to keep in touch and share our news (internally and with the world). Here is a list of the channels you may need to you in order to communicate with the members :

- [Discourse](https://discourse.mozilla-community.org) is the new mailing list-alike we are using for the community, this is where everything is discussed by all the members. Sign up and join the [Mozilla Tunisia section](https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/c/communities/tunisia) to get all the news and interact (Notification will be send via email if you're away)
- [Github](http://github.com/moztn) is where all the community projects are, also used by the teams to track their tasks and activities.
- [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) is our tchit-tchat tool, this is where you can find the members talking about everything and nothing (using the mobile app is very practical)
- IRC : We're using our channel #mozillatunisia for large group meetings (check out how to use and use IRC from this [wiki page](http://wiki.mozilla-tunisia.org/IRC))
- [Wiki](wiki.mozilla-tunisia.org) : We're using, as well as the other open source communities, a wiki for documentations (we are currently looking for contributors to get back our wiki to live)
- [The facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/951349904910566/) has as mission to group members in one place so they can socialize and share content related to Mozilla.
